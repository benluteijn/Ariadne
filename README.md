Ariadne: F# library for Gaussian processes
=======================

Ariadne is an F# library for Gaussian process regression. More information
is available in the [documentation](http://evelinag.github.io/Ariadne).



Future goals
----------------------

 * Implement other methods for hyperparameter optimization, for example stochastic gradient
   descent and conjugate gradients. 

 * Implement sparse methods for fitting Gaussian processes which allow applications
   to larger datasets. 

 * Add other covariance functions.
