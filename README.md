Ariadne: F# library for Gaussian processes
=======================





The library includes tests that validate exact likelihood and posterior computation
against [GPML Matlab package](http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml) and [Math.NET]().

Future goals
----------------------

 * Implement other methods for hyperparameter optimization, namely stochastic gradient
   descent and conjugate gradients. 

 * Implement sparse methods for fitting Gaussian processes to allow applications
   to larger datasets. 

 * Add other covariance functions.
